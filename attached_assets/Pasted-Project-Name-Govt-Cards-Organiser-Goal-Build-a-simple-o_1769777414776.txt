🧠 Data Design (data/data.json)

Use this exact structure:

{
  "people": [
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "name": "Shakeel Ahmed",
      "cards": {
        "aadhaar": "shakeel_aadhaar.pdf",
        "pan": "shakeel_pan.pdf"
      }
    }
  ],
  "cardTypes": ["aadhaar", "pan", "voterid", "ration"]
}

🏠 index.html (Home)

Simple layout with two buttons:

Browse by Cards

Browse by People

Clicking navigates to cards.html or people.html

🪪 cards.html (Browse by Card Type)

List all card types dynamically from JSON

On clicking a card type:

Show all people who have that card

Clicking a person opens the PDF in a new tab

👨‍👩‍👧 people.html (Browse by People)

List all people from JSON

Clicking a person:

Show all cards they have

Clicking a card opens the PDF in new tab

➕ Management Features (IMPORTANT)

Implement simple UI forms (or prompt-based inputs) to:

People

Add new person

Delete existing person

Cards

Add card to a person

Remove card from a person

⚠️ When adding a card:

User provides card type

User provides PDF filename

PDF must be assumed to exist inside correct folder
